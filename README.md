# Matematikk Complex Number Python Impelmentation
## Function handle the complex number equation 
- Input taken by Z^n = a where a = x + iy
- The function can take either in normal form or an equation in Cartesian form
- Handle and calculate the Tetha angle and give result with Python matPlot and in Polar form  ex. Z = r cos (π) + i sin (π)
